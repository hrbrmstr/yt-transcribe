<img src="./httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgaI6kBVyu00_thumb_0.jpg"><p> These ants have been trained to design and build an igloo using tiny blocks of ice.<p>
 Once the igloo is complete, the ants take a well-deserved rest.<p>
 We'll come back to the ants later.<p>
 In the meantime,<p>

 Thanks.<p>
 Experiment 2.<p>
 An experiment was carried out to determine the effects of nitrogen gas upon water.<p>
 First, a sample of water was taken.<p>
!<p>
 Next, a Jane Grey's pipe is fitted to the nozzle of a canister of nitrogen.<p>
 Thank you.<p>
<img src="./httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgaI6kBVyu00_thumb_60.jpg"><p> The Jane Grey is placed in the beaker of water.<p>
 We're using about 10 pence worth of gas.<p>
 Now we turn on the canister to release nitrogen.<p>
 The gas miffipulates gently through the jane grey and into the water, causing bubbling.<p>
 Thank you.<p>
<img src="./httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgaI6kBVyu00_thumb_90.jpg"><p> The mafipulation is allowed to continue for five minutes.<p>
 When the time is up, we turn off the gas and free the Jane Grey from the beaker.<p>
 Now let's take a look at our water sample.<p>
 If you look carefully, you'll notice that the water has changed colour from invisible,<p>
 Invisible,<p>
<img src="./httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgaI6kBVyu00_thumb_120.jpg"><p> to brown.<p>
 What we have produced is imbenzaline nitrotamine,<p>
 more commonly known as whiskey.<p>
 Whisky is a pleasant tasting, thirst quenching drink, and it's enjoyed by all.<p>
 Now let's rejoin the ants and see how they're settling into their igloo.<p>
 A change has taken place.<p>
 The end is a change has taken place.<p>

<img src="./httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgaI6kBVyu00_thumb_150.jpg"><p> Igloo appears to have melted.<p>
 Perhaps the scientist forgot to turn off a bunsen.<p>
 Water, water, water, what hast thou donest?<p>
 Bless you, ants.<p>
 Blance.<p>
