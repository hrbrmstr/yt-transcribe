 Let's get started.<p>
 Oh, Toad is asleep.<p>
 Maybe Bird could do the video instead.<p>
 Welcome back to the Sand Pond saga.<p>
 Look, what's wrong, Bird?<p>
 You don't want to do the video?<p>
 That's okay.<p>
 That's okay.<p>
<img src="./httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvZMklf0vUl18_thumb_30.jpg"><p> Let's find someone else instead.<p>
 In these videos, we use lots of<p>
 We use lots of complicated words.<p>
 But in this video, let's set the record straight.<p>
<img src="./httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvZMklf0vUl18_thumb_60.jpg"><p> and define what they mean.<p>
 Welcome back to the Sandpond saga.<p>
 Let's get started.<p>
 First, let's define what a programming language is.<p>
 I speak English, UK edition.<p>
 Unfortunately, my computer does not,<p>
 but it does speak a bunch of programming languages that<p>
<img src="./httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvZMklf0vUl18_thumb_90.jpg"><p> I also speak, like HTML, which I used to make this little game.<p>
 You have to catch all the birds, put them in a cage, and when you've done that, you get<p>
 a little victory screen.<p>
 Okay, I didn't just use HTML, that wouldn't work.<p>
 I used another programming language too, called CSS, to tell the<p>
<img src="./httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvZMklf0vUl18_thumb_120.jpg"><p> computer what to do. Sorry to interrupt, I'm editing the video right now and I've just<p>
 realized that HTML is not a real programming language. It's actually a markup language. So<p>
 when you use it, you're not actually programming, you're markuping instead. So a better example<p>
 would be a Turing complete program.<p>
<img src="./httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvZMklf0vUl18_thumb_150.jpg"><p> growing language, like Microsoft PowerPoint.<p>
 Let's define what a cellular automata is.<p>
 A cellular automator is where you have cells and you have rules.<p>
 The rules tell the cells what to do.<p>
 Sandlab is a new cellular automata that I made.<p>
 Cells follow rules to split, merge and change color.<p>
 change color.<p>
<img src="./httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvZMklf0vUl18_thumb_180.jpg"><p> to simulate different elements.<p>
 Sorry to interrupt again. I'm editing the video and I've just found out that Sandlab is not actually a cellular automata. It's an agent-based model.<p>
 A better example would be something deterministic and fixed, like Tetris.<p>
 Sorry to interrupt again, but I've just found out that Tetris is also not a cellular automata.<p>
 It's a cellular automaton. A better example would be Tetris Multiplayer Multiplayer.<p>
 I'm glad.<p>
<img src="./httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvZMklf0vUl18_thumb_210.jpg"><p> because it has multiple cellular automaton in it.<p>
 Sorry to interrupt again, but I'm realizing that these interruptions are making the video take too long.<p>
 So to speed things up, I decided to do the next two sections.<p>
 At the same time, let's define<p>
 intelligence.<p>
 Intelligence is something that dynamically preserves its pattern, and this pattern can take for many.<p>
<img src="./httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvZMklf0vUl18_thumb_240.jpg"><p> forms. Like Fish Lab. Fish Lab is an intelligence engine that I made. Fish can swing<p>
 swam forwards and turn up and down. They grow when they eat a circle and shrink when they eat a square.<p>
 When they get big enough, they split into two, causing everything about them to mutate,<p>
 including their brains, which control their own their own.<p>
<img src="./httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvZMklf0vUl18_thumb_270.jpg"><p> in intelligent behaviors.<p>
 Sorry to interrupt again, I'm editing the video right now and I've just realized that these fish are not an example of intelligence.<p>
 They're actually artificial intelligence.<p>
 Because they're just drawings.<p>
 Drawings.<p>
 Sorry to interrupt again, I'm editing the video right now<p>
 and I've just found out that they're not artificial intelligence either.<p>
 Because there's no way of telling if they have a consciousness.<p>
 They're not.<p>
<img src="./httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvZMklf0vUl18_thumb_300.jpg"><p> They're actually artificial, artificial intelligence.<p>
 Let's define fractal.<p>
 A fractal is a pattern with infinite detail.<p>
 No matter how far you zoom in, there's always more to discover.<p>
 An example of a fractal is a fractal because no matter how far you zoom in, no matter how much you break it down,<p>
<img src="./httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvZMklf0vUl18_thumb_330.jpg"><p> no matter how long you do this for.<p>
 Sorry to interrupt, I'm editing the video right now and I've just realized that a fractal is not a fractal.<p>
 It's actually a fractal. So a better example of a fractal would be a fractal.<p>
 Sorry to interrupt again, but I've just realized that a fractal is not a fractal. It's actually a fractal.<p>
 A better example of a fractal, a fractal, a better example of a fractal,<p>
<img src="./httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvZMklf0vUl18_thumb_360.jpg"><p> would be a fractal.<p>
 Sorry to interrupt again.<p>
 I've just realized that a fractal, well, it's not actually a fractal because if you break it down fully,<p>
 sorry to interrupt, it's actually a fractal.<p>
 Because it's not actually a fractal,<p>
 technically, because when you go in each interrupt, I've just realized that what you might keep going through that<p>
 is not actually a fractal.<p>
<p>
 Sorry, I've really realized that only found that information.<p>
 I think you're right.<p>
<img src="./httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvZMklf0vUl18_thumb_390.jpg"><p> Let's define our tool that we use to make<p>
 let's define art.<p>
 Art is a tool that we use to express ourselves and communicate.<p>
 Sometimes the art is a tool that you make,<p>
 tells us something about you.<p>
<img src="./httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvZMklf0vUl18_thumb_420.jpg"><p> Personally, I like to play little tunes on the baritone ukulele.<p>
 It's not meant to be heard by anyone, but it helps me to express how I'm feeling, and I find<p>
 it quite fun.<p>
 Sorry to interrupt, I'm editing, I'm editing the ukulele, and I'm just realized that playing that playing<p>
 the ukulele is not.<p>
<img src="./httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvZMklf0vUl18_thumb_450.jpg"><p> art. It's actually just annoying the neighbours. A real example of art is AI art. So I asked<p>
 GPT to make some prompts for me, which I gave to Dali and turned into an NFT. I put it on OpenC<p>
 and sold it for lots of money. Now that's real art. Define Define. A definition is a tool that we<p>
<img src="./httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvZMklf0vUl18_thumb_480.jpg"><p> to express ourselves and communicate.<p>
 Sometimes the definition is for other people and sometimes it's just for you.<p>
 The definition that you use tells us something about you.<p>
 Personally, I like to use definitions very loosely.<p>
 But what about you? What definitions do you use?<p>
<img src="./httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvZMklf0vUl18_thumb_510.jpg"><p> I'm going to be.<p>
<img src="./httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvZMklf0vUl18_thumb_540.jpg"><p> I'm going to be.<p>
